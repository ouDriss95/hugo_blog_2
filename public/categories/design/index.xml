But I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I could achieve what I wanted with free templates, In addition I found it complicated because I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with React. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to worry about resolving issues every time I wanted to tweak something, so I went with Hugo, which only requires a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS.</description></item></channel></rss>
