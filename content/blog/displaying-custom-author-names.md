By default, Shopify themes will display a blog post author based on staff admin accounts but itâ€™s possible to edit the article template and display any author name you would like with the help of custom fields. So let me show you how to feature a guest blogger who you would like to credit as the author

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
2. Find the Minimal theme, and then click **Actions** > **Duplicate**.
3. Find the theme that called _Copy of Minimal_ then click **Actions** > **Edit Code**.
4. On the left bar, search for a folder called _Sections_ then find a file called "article-template.liquid".
5. Inside the "article-template.liquid" file replace the following code

```html {linenos=table}
{% if article.metafields.author.name %}
<span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
{{ article.metafields.author.name }} {% else %}
<span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
{{ article.author }} {% endif %}
```

with the one is highlighted below. That highlighted code is between line 25-26 in your code editor

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["2-3"],linenostart=1}
{% if section.settings.article_author_enable %}
   <span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
   {{ article.author }}
{% endif %}
```

6. Next, On the same folder which is _Sections_. Find a file called "blog-template.liquid"

**7.** Inside the "blog-template.liquid" file replace the following code

```html {linenos=table}
{% if article.metafields.author.name %}
   <span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
   {{ article.metafields.author.name }}
{% else %}
   <span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
   {{ article.author }}
{% endif %}
```

with the one is highlighted below. That highlighted code is between line 27-28 in your code editor

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["2-3"],linenostart=1}
{% if section.settings.blog_author_enable %}
   <span class="meta-sep">&#8226;</span>
   {{ article.author }}
{% endif %}
```

**8.** Now, we are going to need custom fields in order to make each post with its own author name! so in this case we
will need to install an app called [Metafields
Guru](https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-editor-2?surface_detail=metafields&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=4&surface_type=search)

**9.** After you install the app, select Blogs & Posts then choose one of your posts that you want to feature the guest blogger.

**10.** After you choose the post, click on _Create Metafield_ button.

**11.** Now you can see a Form appeared after you click on _Create Metafield_, inside the input with name of "Key" start writing **name** and inside the input with the name of "Namespace" start writing **author**. Next, write the name of the author guest inside the last input which is the tallest one!

**12.** After you finish creating the name of the author guest, click on **Save** button.

Once this is added, we can view the article and the name of guest author will appear as the article author. I hope this article guide is helpful for you!
